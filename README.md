I created a weather dashboard using HTML, CSS, JS, and a third party API where you can search the weather for any city.
It also has a 5 day forecast.

When you first load the page it will be blank and there will be a search bar on the left.

You can type a city in the search bar and click "Search".
You will be shown the the city name that you searched, date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV-Index for today.
You can also see an image of the current weather condition.
You will also be shown the date, an image of the weather condition, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the next five days.

When you shrink the website down, it is mobile responsive.

This project is still incomplete.
Ideally when I finish the input box will clear itself after clicking search.
The cities that you look up will also save to the left hand side under the search bar. You will be able to click them and see the weather conditions.
It will also look a lot more pleasing to the eyes.
